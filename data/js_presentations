presenter should speed up (shown as red) or has the\nluxury of slowing down (blue).\n\nThe pacing timer can be enabled by configuring by the `defaultTiming`\nparameter in the `Reveal` configuration block, which specifies the\nnumber of seconds per slide.  120 can be a reasonable rule of thumb.\nTimings can also be given per slide `<section>` by setting the\n`data-timing` attribute.  Both values are in numbers of seconds.\n\nWhen the option is enabled, clicking on the timers will reset the timer\nto the beginning of the current slide, i.e. as if pacing was perfectly\non track, not to zero as if the presentation had just begun.","tree":{"sha":"34931979c899769e2ed3ed9dd79f6917e0c84529","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/etra0/js_presentations/git/trees/34931979c899769e2ed3ed9dd79f6917e0c84529"},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/etra0/js_presentations/git/commits/715cf0ba11db0f913cfd2edb56a2c66aed57b505","comment_count":0,"verification":{"verified":false,"reason":"unsigned","signature":null,"payload":null}},"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/etra0/js_presentations/commits/715cf0ba11db0f913cfd2edb56a2c66aed57b505","html_url":"https://github.com/etra0/js_presentations/commit/715cf0ba11db0f913cfd2edb56a2c66aed57b505","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/etra0/js_presentations/commits/715cf0ba11db0f913cfd2edb56a2c66aed57b505/comments","author":{"login":"aspiers","id":100738,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/100738?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspiers","html_url":"https://github.com/aspiers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspiers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspiers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspiers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspiers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspiers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspiers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspiers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspiers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspiers/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"committer":{"login":"aspiers","id":100738,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/100738?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspiers","html_url":"https://github.com/aspiers","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspiers/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspiers/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspiers/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspiers/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspiers/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspiers/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspiers/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspiers/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aspiers/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"parents":[{"sha":"921a605567e8c08409fefa2cea75f66c851de748","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/etra0/js_presentations/commits/921a605567e8c08409fefa2cea75f66c851de748","html_url":"https://github.com/etra0/js_presentations/commit/921a605567e8c08409fefa2cea75f66c851de748"}]},{"sha":"921a605567e8c08409fefa2cea75f66c851de748","commit":{"author":{"name":"Adam
